The repository includes an installation guide (installation\_guide.txt) for different operating systems and explanation of the examples (explanation\_of\_ROLL\_examples.txt) included in the source code (ROLL\_examples folder).

In more details, this source code provides:

- implementation of several routing metrics (HC, ETX, RSSI, RE, PFI),

- implementation of authentication and encryption constraints,

- implementation of routing metrics composition approaches (lexical, additive),

- implementation of ~30 Objective Code Points (OCP) by combining different set of metrics,

- support of multiple instances (construction of multiple DODAGs),

- configuration of different topologies,

- management capabilities, such as saving results, visualizing performance metrics, changing node or link characteristics during run-time,

- implementation of a powerful GUI tool for debugging, visualizing and demonstrating routing performance.
